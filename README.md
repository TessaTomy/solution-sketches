# 🧠 _solution-sketches_

_A personal archive of LeetCode problems I've solved — written in **C** 🧵 and **Python** 🐍, shaped for clarity, modularity, and future readability._

_Each sketch reflects how I approach problems — from traversal rhythm to structural choices._
_These aren't just answers; they're authored routines built to be revisited, reused, and refined._
